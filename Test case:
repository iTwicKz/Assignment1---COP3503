If you have given matrics of size matrics[3][3] size,

solution: 2 7 6
          9 5 1
          4 3 8
          
          
Here sum of first row,second row and third row and both digonals becomes 15.

sum of natural numbers from  1 to 9 =45,
so you have to make each row's sum and both digonals sum be 15,
